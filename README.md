# VoTeX
*Online Assignments Made Easy*

## Inspiration

Today, many students and teachers face the need to type out equations and formulas for their science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classes. This problem is only made worse by online schooling, forcing teachers and students to either type out their notes and worksheets, or have to handwrite them. 

Typically, many people use solutions like Microsoft Word to type out equations and format their documents, but this can get confusing and difficult. An alternative solution to this is LaTeX, which poses its own problems: it is time consuming, difficult, and confusing to learn and many teachers and students will not learn it. This is where **VoTeX** comes into play. VoTeX makes it easier to go from written or spoken work to LaTeX, via just your voice.
